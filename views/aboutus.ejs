            <h2 class="mb-3">Our Story</h2>
            <p class="text-muted">Founded in 2024, Canvas Couture started with a simple idea: to transform everyday
              fashion into a vibrant expression of art.</p>
            <p>Canvas Couture is a clothing brand designed for dreamers, creators, and those who see life as a canvas.
              Experience a unique fusion of fashion and art, where every piece of clothing is inspired by and named
              after legendary artists, art movements, or iconic masterpieces. The store is designed to feel like an art
              gallery, with each collection curated as if it were an exhibit. Customers not only buy clothes but immerse
              themselves in a world where fashion meets fine art. From the bold colors of Van Gogh’s "Starry Night" to
              the minimalist elegance of Mondrian’s geometric shapes, every garment is a wearable piece of art</p>
